            <h2> <i> History</i></h2>
            <p> Girl Develop It was started in 2010 by <a href= "#">Vanessa Hurst</a> and <a href="#">Sara Chipps[9]</a> in <a href="#">New York City</a>. 
                GDI started with just one class that sold out in one day.[1] In 2017, 
                the organization reported chapters in 53 cities[10] in 33 states and districts in the <a href="#">United States[7]</a> and one in  <a href="#">Ottawa, Ontario Canada</a>.
                In January 2019, following controversies surrounding transparency and efficacy of the GDI staff after allegations of racism,[8]
                former chapter leaders estimated that only three chapters were actively organizing classes.[11] As of July 2019 GDI lists 55,000 members in 60 chapters in the <a href= "#">United States</a> and none in other countries. 
                However, only five of these chapters are actively organizing classes and events.[7]

            <h2> Founders</h2>
            <p> 
                <h3> Vanessa Hurst</h3>
                Hurst is a <a href="#">computer programmer, social entrepreneur</a>, teacher,[1] and lifetime <a href="#">girl scout,[12]</a>and a co-founder of Girl Develop It. 
                In 2013 she launched the CodeMontage platform. She is also responsible for founding and running Developers For Good and also NYC-based Network of Technologists. 
                She is currently based in Charlottesville.[12] Hurst served on the board of GDI until the 2018 controversy, at which point she resigned her position on the board.[13]

            <h2> Controversies</h2>
            <p>
                On August 19, 2018, the leadership of a GDI chapter in Minneapolis were accused of discriminating against a woman of color via a Twitter post.[14] 
                In the post, a community member brought allegations to light that indicated two white GDI chapter leaders in Minneapolis had actively excluded another chapter leader in the Minneapolis chapter who is a woman of color.
                These actions resulted in her stepping down as a chapter leader. As a result of the lack of acknowledgement of this incident by the GDI Executive Director and board members, another chapter leader decided to step down from her position[15] citing "race and feminism and the way organizations deal with being called out" as one of the reasons for leaving.
                On December 3, 2018, further allegations of racism towards women of color came to light, this time from a former GDI HQ employee[16] in an episode of the #causeascene podcast.[17] In the episode, the former employee details many ways in which she experienced racism during her time working with GDI leadership, which ultimately led to her resigning from her position.
                On December 7,2018, various Chapter Leaders across the United States released an open letter to GDI HQ and board,[18] demanding change in leadership due to racism allegations. By December 10, 2018, at least two chapters across the United States decided to go on hiatus in protest.[19]
                On December 12, 2018, GDI released an official statement of acknowledgement,[20] outlining policy changes to address issues. Founder Vanessa Hurst stepped down from her position as board chair on December 11, 2018.[13] Executive Director Corinne Warnshuis resigned in April 2019.[21]
                Former GDI chapter leaders, instructors, and volunteers created the hashtag #gdistrike to share updates and information about the controversy on <a href="#">Twitter.[22]</a> The organizers have also created a detailed timeline of events that is updated periodically with news about active chapters and leadership changes.[23]
